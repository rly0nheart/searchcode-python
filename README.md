### Code Search

Queries the code index and returns at most 100 results.

#### Params

- `query`: Search term (required).
    - The following filters are textual and can be added into query directly
        - Filter by file extention **ext:EXTENTION** e.g., _"gsub ext:erb"_
        - Filter by language **lang:LANGUAGE** e.g., _"import lang:python"_
        - Filter by repository **repo:REPONAME** e.g., _"float Q_rsqrt repo:quake"_
        - Filter by user/repository **repo:USERNAME/REPONAME** e.g., _"batf repo:boyter/batf"_
- `page`: Result page starting at 0 through to 49
- `per_page`: Number of results wanted per page (max 100).
- `languages`: List of programming languages to filter by.
- `sources`: List of code sources (e.g., GitHub, BitBucket).
- `lines_of_code_gt`: Filter to sources with greater lines of code than supplied int. Valid values 0 to 10000.
- `lines_of_code_lt`: Filter to sources with less lines of code than supplied int. Valid values 0 to 10000.
- `callback`: Callback function (JSONP only)

> If the results list is empty, then this indicates that you have reached the end of the available results.

> To fetch all results for a given query, keep incrementing `page` parameter until you get a page with an empty results
> list.

#### Code Search Without Filters

```python

import searchcode as sc

search = sc.code_search(query="test")

for result in search.results:
    print(result)
```

#### Filter by Language (Java and JavaScript)

```python

import searchcode as sc

search = sc.code_search(query="test", languages=["Java", "JavaScript"])

for result in search.results:
    print(result.language)
```

#### Filter by Source (BitBucket and CodePlex)

```python

import searchcode as sc

search = sc.code_search(query="test", sources=["BitBucket", "CodePlex"])

for result in search.results:
    print(result.filename)
```

#### Filter by Lines of Code (Between 500 and 1000)

```python

import searchcode as sc

search = sc.code_search(query="test", lines_of_code_gt=500, lines_of_code_lt=1000)

for result in search.results:
    print(result)
```

#### With Callback Function (JSONP only)

```python
import searchcode as sc

search = sc.code_search(query="test", callback="myCallback")
print(search)
```
